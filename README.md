Hello I'm Atomdonat.
Currently I'm a Cyber Security (B.Sc.) student of the Ruhr-Universit√§t-Bochum (Germany). Besides learning I'm interested in playing games like WarThunder or Battlefield.
My programming skills are improvable and only include the basics of Java and Python yet. In the future I want to setup my own website for gaming, while hosting multiple 
gameservers and organize tournaments, to unify multiple (lonely) gamers and clans.
